_This is a community project meant for playing around with Zeebe. It is not officially supported by the Zeebe Team (i.e. no gurantees). Everybody is invited to contribute!_
A Zeebe worker to evaluate scripts (i.e. script tasks). Scripts are useful for prototyping, to do (simple) calculations, or creating/modifying variables.

## Usage

Example BPMN with service task:

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="scripting" name="Evaluate the Script">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <zeebe:taskDefinition type="script" />
    <zeebe:taskHeaders>
      <zeebe:header key="language" value="javascript" />
      <zeebe:header key="script" value="a + b" />
    </zeebe:taskHeaders>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

* the worker is registered for the type `script`
* required custom headers:
  * `language` - the name of the script language
  * `script` - the script to evaluate
* available context/variables in script:
  * `job` (ActivatedJob) - the current job
  * `zeebeClient` (ZeebeClient) - the client of the worker
* the result of the evaluation is passed as `result` variable

Available script languages:
* [javascript](https://www.graalvm.org/) (GraalVM JS)
* [groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
* [mustache](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html)
* [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

## Install

### Docker

The docker image for the worker is published on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/camunda-community-hub/packages/container/package/zeebe-script-worker).

```
docker pull ghcr.io/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-script-worker:1.2.0
```
* configure the connection to the Zeebe broker by setting `zeebe.client.broker.contactPoint` (default: `localhost:26500`)

For a local setup, the repository contains a [docker-compose file](docker/docker-compose.yml). It starts a Zeebe broker and the worker.

```
cd docker
docker-compose up
```

### Manual

1. Download the latest [worker JAR](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-script-worker/releases) _(zeebe-script-worker-%{VERSION}.jar
)_

1. Start the worker
    `java -jar zeebe-script-worker-{VERSION}.jar`

### Configuration

The worker is a Spring Boot application that uses the [Spring Zeebe Starter](https://github.com/zeebe-io/spring-zeebe). The configuration can be changed via environment variables or an `application.yaml` file. See also the following resources:
* [Spring Zeebe Configuration](https://github.com/zeebe-io/spring-zeebe#configuring-zeebe-connection)
* [Spring Boot Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config)
